# SysNat

***is a tool to manage the progress in software quality. This is achieved by***
1. writing and managing requirements as Executable Examples, 
3. enabling developers in various ways to translate natural language instructions in programm code
3. executing the requirements as automated tests 
4. generating current documentation about your software system. 

***This software development tool is made for***
- driving requirements through a life cycle that you (or rather your team) define
- translating natural language in programm code (with a minimum of developer effort)
- executing the system requirements as automated tests (by any team member also in a purely non-technical role)
- generating requirement documentations about the current state of your software system
- generating system description documenation

***Applying *SysNat* consequently is supposed to have the following effects in the long run:***

a) Exectuable Examples become the Single Point of Truth (no or no unknown deviation between the application itself, its programm code and its description).

b) There is always a current system documentation (it can be generated within seconds).

c) Non-technical team members are able to modify existing Executable Examples, to create new ones and to execute them on their own without technical support (because the natural language used is intuitively understandable).

Technical Requirements:

- Java 8 \*
- Eclipse or IntelliJ \*
- Junit 4
- Selenium 

\* These two requirements are not part of this repository and must be provided by you. 

_SysNat_ is optimized for the use under *Windows*. There is no known reason why _SysNat_ should not work under other operation systems but it is currently not yet tested.
