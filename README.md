# SysNatTesting

SysNatTesting (or in short: SysNat or SNT) stands for a testing tool to perform system tests in natural language. Its main features are

- Formulate instructions in natural language that both operates your application under test and asserts the corresponding expectations.
- Created a test report with an test result overview as well as detailed information about any instruction, expectations and results - all presented in natural language.

With these main features, SysNatTesting is perfectly suitable to bring domain experts and developers together, in order to build a Domain Specific Language (DSL) in natural language.
Once established, this DSL allows domain experts to modify tests, to create tests and to execute them without any technical support, because the natural language is intuitively understandable.

Minor features of the SysNatTesting are:

- Internationalization (any language can be used, see English and German examples below)
- DSL Scripting (allows creation of natural language scripts that can be reused for different test cases - calling scripts in other scripts is possible as well)
- Easy import of test data (".dat" files for data structured as key-value pairs or Excel-data for data structured as tables)
- Repeated test execution (write one test and execute it many times with different datasets)

Technical Requirements:

- Eclipe Neon
- Java 8
- JUnit 4
