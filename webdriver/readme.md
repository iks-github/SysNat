This *webdriver* directory is supposed to contain all external stuff needed to launch a web browser. For Firefox 45 and higher this is the geckodriver. For different versions of firefox different versions of geckodrivers have to be used. By default, *SysNat* tries to find the Firefox installed in the default installation directory of which is "C://Program Files//Mozilla Firefox". You may change the SysNat default in the *execution.properties* to a different Firefox location.

If you wish to use a different (older or younger) Firefox version than installed on your computer, then download your favorite version from https://mozilla-firefox.de.uptodown.com/windows/versions and install it into this webdriver directory. Furthermore, set the corresponding path to it in the *execution.properties* and the correct geckodriver version (trial and error let you find it).
